# The Effective Velocity of Transferred Mass: How Momentum Prescriptions Determine Binary Orbital Evolution

In binary stellar evolution, the orbital response to mass transfer depends on how angular momentum is redistributed---a choice encoded in the momentum prescription applied to the transferred material. We introduce a one-parameter family of prescriptions characterized by $\eta$, the fractional weight of the donor velocity in the effective velocity of the transferred mass: $\vtrans = \eta\,\mathbf{v}_1 + (1-\eta)\,\mathbf{v}_2$. We derive a closed-form expression for the angular momentum change per transfer event, $\dL/L = \delta m\,[(1-\eta)/M_2 - \eta/M_1]$, valid for circular orbits with impulsive transfer. The two endpoint prescriptions ($\eta = 1$ and $\eta = 0$) produce angular momentum changes of opposite sign, yielding qualitatively different orbital evolution---contraction versus expansion---at every mass ratio. Conservative mass transfer ($\dL = 0$) corresponds uniquely to $\eta = M_1/\mtot$, i.e.\ $\vtrans = \vcom$. For constant~$\eta$, we derive the general closed-form solution $a_f/a_0 = [(1-f)^{2(1-\eta)}(1+fq_0)^{2\eta}]^{-1}$, which recovers all special cases. These results expose a hidden modelling freedom in widely used conservative-transfer prescriptions: the assumption $\vtrans = \vcom$ is not a neutral default but a specific, mass-ratio--dependent momentum-closure choice. The $\eta$-family does not introduce new physics; it makes this choice explicit and supplies a calibratable axis along which departures from conservation can be systematically explored.
